                <a href="#faq1">What is the best way to reach Manali?</a>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The nearest railway station from Manali is in Joginder Nagar which is 50 km away. However, this is a narrow gauge railway station and hence is not connected to all the major cities in the country. The broad gauge railway stations nearest to Manali are in Chandigarh (310 km) and Ambala (300 km). The nearest airport is in Bhuntar, which is also 50 km away. Buses and taxis are easily available from these places and other parts of North India to Manali. Manali can also be reached from Leh by the Leh-Manali route, though it is open for only 4 or 5 months in a year during summers when the snow is removed by the Border Road Organization of India. Still, this road is very picturesque and is one of the most beautiful ways to reach Manali.</p>
